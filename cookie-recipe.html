      <h3>The History of Cookies</h3> 
      <p>
        Most people don't know the complicated past of the cookie. The chocolate chip cookie was invented by the American chef Ruth Graves Wakefield  
        and chef Sue Brides in 1938. She invented the recipe during the period when she owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts. The original 
        recipe in Toll House Tried and True Recipes is called "Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookies." To honor the cookie's creation in the state, on July 
        9, 1997, Massachusetts designated the chocolate chip cookie as the Official State Cookie, after it was proposed by a third-grade class from 
        Somerset, Massachusetts.
